# PHP Framework Services

It is a small framework to execute continuous processing services that allows you to return any simple php script to a service on your server, being able to choose the time interval that you want to run a service and obtain a result through a text file whose name you can customize

all services must be saved with short names within the PHP folder.


#### The method of use is as follows:

`PHP Services > services  start t=(interval of time) f=(filename of service without extension)  (name of file of log without extension)`
